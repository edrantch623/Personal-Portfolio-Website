# Personal-Portfolio-Website
Personal Portfolio Site


I created this site as a demonstration and practice of my learnings with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have linked some projects I have done in my journey learning Full Stack Development. 

This is the the second site I have created to showcase my progress in learning and to become a developer. This site connects to my currently built projects, as well as being a dynamic webpage for both desktop and mobile view. Additionaly, this site can be toggle "Dark Mode" appearance on and off, and is connected to a weather API to display local weather temperature and sky conditions for Minneapolis, MN. 

Tools Used: 
-HTML 
-CSS
-Javascript
-Git and Github
-WeatherURL API
