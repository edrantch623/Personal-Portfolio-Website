Personal Portfolio Site


I created this site as a demonstration and practice of my learnings with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have linked some projects I have done in my journey learning Front End Development. 

This is the the second site I have created to showcase my progress in learning and to become a developer. 

Tools Used: 
-HTML/CSS/Javascript/Git/Chrome Dev Tools
